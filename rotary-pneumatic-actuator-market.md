<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rotary Pneumatic Actuator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Double Acting Pneumatic Actuator</li><li>Single Acting Pneumatic Actuator</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The rotary pneumatic actuator market is categorized mainly into double-acting and single-acting pneumatic actuators. Double-acting actuators use air pressure to both open and close the valve, providing greater control and response times, making them ideal for applications requiring precise positioning. Single-acting actuators, on the other hand, use air pressure for one direction while relying on a spring for the return, making them simpler and often more cost-effective for applications where precise control is less critical.</p></p>
