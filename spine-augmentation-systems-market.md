<p><strong>The Spine Augmentation Systems Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Percutaneous Kyphoplasty</li><li>Percutaneous Vertebroplasty</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The spine augmentation systems market encompasses applications like percutaneous kyphoplasty and percutaneous vertebroplasty, which are minimally invasive procedures aimed at treating vertebral compression fractures. Percutaneous kyphoplasty involves the insertion of a balloon to restore vertebral height before injecting cement, effectively stabilizing the fracture and alleviating pain. In contrast, percutaneous vertebroplasty directly injects cement into the fractured vertebra to provide immediate support. Both techniques enhance patient mobility and quality of life while reducing the need for extensive surgical interventions.</p></p>
