<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The HF Electrotome Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Unipolar Type</li><li>Bipolar Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The HF Electrotome market is divided into two primary types: unipolar and bipolar. Unipolar electrotomes deliver current through a single electrode, offering precise cutting with minimal thermal damage, ideal for delicate tissues. In contrast, bipolar electrotomes utilize two electrodes, allowing current to flow between them, which enhances control and reduces collateral thermal effects, making them suitable for more focused applications. Both types are essential in surgical settings for effective tissue dissection and coagulation, catering to varied surgical needs.</p></p>
