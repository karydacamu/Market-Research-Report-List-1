<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Calcined Diatomite Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Anhydrous Substance</li><li>Flux Calcined</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The calcined diatomite market is primarily classified into two types: anhydrous substance and flux calcined diatomite. Anhydrous substance refers to diatomaceous earth that has been subjected to high temperatures to remove moisture, enhancing its purity and absorptive properties. Flux calcined diatomite, on the other hand, undergoes a specific calcination process at controlled temperatures, which alters its chemical structure, making it suitable for applications requiring improved flow and lower viscosity. Both types are essential in industries like filtration, construction, and agriculture.</p></p>
