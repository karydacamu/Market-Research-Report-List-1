<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electrical Bone Growth Stimulators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>External Type</li><li>Implanted Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The electrical bone growth stimulators market is divided into two main types: external and implanted. External stimulators are non-invasive devices applied externally to the skin, utilizing low-intensity pulsed ultrasound or electromagnetic fields to promote bone healing and regeneration. In contrast, implanted stimulators are devices surgically placed within the body to deliver electrical stimulation directly to the bone, enhancing healing in more challenging cases. Both types serve critical roles in orthopedic treatments and rehabilitation, catering to different patient needs.</p></p>
